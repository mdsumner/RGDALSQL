## RGDALSQL

Not much yet. `rgdal2` is still a little fragile, also read only for drawings, and I'm mostly out of my depth there. 

```{r}
library(RGDALSQL)
f = system.file("example-data/continents", package = "rgdal2")
chuck <- rgdal::ogrInfo(f, "continent") ## bizarrely this prevents this problem:
##https://github.com/thk686/rgdal2/issues/7
db <- dbConnect(RGDALSQL::GDALSQL(), f)
dbSendQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM continent WHERE FID < 1")
```

That's only printing out a SQL layer summary for now, need to use the spbabel/gris approach to get the metadata/geometry, perhaps in spbabel form. From there we can feed to other structures and formats.
